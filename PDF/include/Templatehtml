if (*pointer == Metadata) 
Checks for previous data, if non-eligible, it pushes head onto the stack.

After last pop of a head's element, the next explicit non-head or head end will pop the head

Once a body's element have been found push to the stack; if an element end tag has been found, pop from the stack
If there is white space after implied body, document cannot be processed. Body's element must be the first thing or
it would become an implied non part of the body



If implied body has any metadata tags as first and head is omitted, it will be treated as a second head file. This is why body
can only have metadata tags as start or be preceded by bodies if there is a start tag


table rows can follow other table rows and the final one determines the pops of the previous; this is because it will assume
all rows as part of the same table until there is none 

The same applies for the th and td, it will search previous argument until last non eligible is found


if(*pointer == th/td)
{
    if(EndStack[*pointer - 1] == th/td)
        pop(1);
    else 
    {
        while StartStack[*pointer] != th/td    
         {
             pop(1)
         }
    }
}

li can follow other li and last will pop until no li is left

if(*pointer == li)
{
    if(EndStack[*pointer - 1] == li )
        pop(1);
    else 
    {
        while StartStack[*pointer] != li    
         {
             pop(1)
         }
    }
}



option can follow other options and last option end tag will describe the previous and pop the other ones 
if(*pointer == option)
{
    if(EndStack[*pointer - 1] == option )
        pop(1);
    else 
    {
        while StartStack[*pointer] != option    
         {
             pop(1)
         }
    }
}

/*
tbody and thead can follow other tbody and tfoot and the last end tag defines the properties of the previous

Tfoot however still needs an end tag

Tfoot end tag pops the tags of the previous 

form, fielset, details , table, all of sectioning, all of foot, etc seem to default to popping a p it describes  if
the next argument describes that  doesn't pertain to body or any other grouping that wouldnt exist within data. 
Any argument after that belongs to the parent would belong to p.  Start tag is still needed

Any argument from other elments for p will return an error if end tag is not explicit . Even if empty, certain will still cause an error


colgroup  cannot describe which to close if both or more do not have enttag in the nesting
It will default the child to being a non child 
Every group element but one needs an eng tag 

any argument that describes 

metadata needs a head with char set and conditioning httpequiv 

can be used as an intem prop  for any large group of content
also name in any metadata requimrnet or itemprop

can also be used for phrasing 

style can be used for metadata content or a noscirpt in a head

Only one head

Only one body

Body has sectioning content, flow which also has heading content

Every rp needs an rt  or another rp that points to an rt. Ultimately, it needs to be in betweeen all needs to be in front of or behind an rt

text area is self explanetoary

output is phrasing 

legend is first child of a field set 
form is flow
table is flow

noscript is used in head and it cant be nested
can be used in phrasing with same conditons 

script is used for metadat prhasing or script supporting elements 

template  can be used in metadata phrasing or script elments or child of colgroup without span


caption can only be first child
Table must be next if any capiton. There cannot be any sub elemnts 
col can be child of col group whcih doesnt have span
tbody must be after all capiton colgroups and thead  but only if table doesnt have any children
